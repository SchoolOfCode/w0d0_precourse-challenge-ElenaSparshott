        <br>
        A no dig gardening pioneer
    </h1>
    <p id="intro">Charles is based on Homeacres Farm in South Somerset.  The basis of the 'no dig' method is to not dig the garden and disturb the microenviroment but to apply a thick layer of mulch once a year.  The mulch is often good quality compost and vegetables are planted directly into the beds with wonderful results. He started growing vegetables in 1981. Now with 40 years experience Charles runs couses, writes books and has a popular youtube channel.</p>
